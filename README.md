# gbas

`gbas` is an assembler for the Game Boy, a Z80 derivative. The goal of this
project is to provide an assembler syntax for the Z80 as close as possible to
the GNU assembler. Particularly, other assemblers for the Z80 support a
different syntax for assembler directives, such as `.align`. The goal is to
provide a syntax more familiar to Game Boy programmers who have used the GNU
assembler before.
